Insight:
 
A
 
Local
 
Proof
 
of
 
Concept
 
for
 
the
 
"10/10"
 
Power

Summary
 
The
 
convergence
 
of
 
"Code-First"
 
Business
 
Intelligence
 
(BI)
 
and
 
Agentic
 
Integrated
 
Development
 
Environments
 
(IDEs)
 
marks
 
a
 
pivotal
 
inflection
 
point
 
in
 
the
 
lifecycle
 
of
 
analytics
 
development.
 
For
 
nearly
 
a
 
decade,
 
Power
 
BI
 
development
 
was
 
characterized
 
by
 
a
 
"click-heavy,"
 
GUI-centric
 
paradigm,
 
encapsulated
 
within
 
the
 
binary
 
opacity
 
of
 
the
 
.pbix
 
file
 
format.
 
This
 
structure,
 
while
 
accessible,
 
created
 
significant
 
barriers
 
to
 
standardization,
 
version
 
control,
 
and
 
automated
 
quality
 
assurance.
 
However,
 
the
 
introduction
 
of
 
Power
 
BI
 
Projects
 
(.pbip),
 
the
 
Tabular
 
Model
 
Definition
 
Language
 
(TMDL),
 
and
 
the
 
Power
 
BI
 
Enhanced
 
Report
 
Format
 
(PBIR)
 
has
 
fundamentally
 
altered
 
this
 
landscape,
 
exposing
 
the
 
underlying
 
metadata
 
of
 
reports
 
and
 
semantic
 
models
 
as
 
human-readable,
 
editable
 
text
 
files.
1
 
Simultaneously,
 
the
 
emergence
 
of
 
Agentic
 
IDEs,
 
exemplified
 
by
 
Google's
 
Antigravity,
 
provides
 
the
 
orchestration
 
layer
 
necessary
 
to
 
manipulate
 
this
 
exposed
 
metadata
 
at
 
scale.
4
 
Developers
 
are
 
no
 
longer
 
limited
 
to
 
manual
 
interventions;
 
they
 
can
 
now
 
deploy
 
autonomous
 
AI
 
agents
 
to
 
plan,
 
execute,
 
and
 
verify
 
complex
 
standardization
 
tasks
 
across
 
report
 
ecosystems.
 
This
 
report
 
presents
 
a
 
comprehensive,
 
executable
 
Proof
 
of
 
Concept
 
(POC)
 
for
 
a
 
"10/10
 
Power
 
BI
 
Standardization
 
Framework."
 
The
 
framework
 
leverages
 
the
 
local
 
file
 
manipulation
 
capabilities
 
of
 
the
 
Antigravity
 
IDE
 
to
 
establish
 
a
 
"BI
 
Factory"—a
 
structured
 
local
 
environment
 
where
 
reports
 
are
 
treated
 
as
 
software
 
artifacts.
 
Through
 
a
 
suite
 
of
 
Python
 
automations
 
(validator.py,
 
car_wash.py,
 
doc_generator.py),
 
the
 
framework
 
enforces
 
a
 
rigourous
 
quality
 
standard
 
(the
 
"10/10
 
Score")
 
focused
 
on
 
performance,
 
governance,
 
and
 
visual
 
consistency.
 
The
 
POC
 
demonstrates
 
two
 
critical
 
workflows:
 
1.
 
Greenfield
 
Creation:
 
The
 
automated
 
generation
 
of
 
"Gold
 
Standard"
 
reports
 
from
 
pristine
 
templates,
 
ensuring
 
new
 
assets
 
are
 
born
 
compliant.
 
2.
 
Brownfield
 
Remediation:
 
The
 
batch
 
processing
 
of
 
legacy
 
.pbip
 
files,
 
where
 
an
 
automated
 
"Car
 
Wash"
 
cycle
 
sanitizes
 
technical
 
debt—disabling
 
auto-date/time,
 
injecting
 
corporate
 
themes,
 
and
 
standardizing
 
visual
 
configurations.
 
By
 
moving
 
from
 
document-based
 
guidelines
 
to
 
code-based
 
enforcement,
 
this
 
framework
 
creates
 
a
 
deterministic
 
pathway
 
to
 
high-quality
 
BI,
 
reducing
 
the
 
maintenance
 
burden
 
and
 

ensuring
 
that
 
every
 
report
 
deployed
 
aligns
 
with
 
organizational
 
best
 
practices.
 
2.
 
The
 
Paradigm
 
Shift:
 
From
 
Files
 
to
 
Folder
 
Structures
 
To
 
understand
 
the
 
architecture
 
of
 
the
 
proposed
 
BI_Factory,
 
one
 
must
 
first
 
appreciate
 
the
 
shift
 
in
 
the
 
underlying
 
storage
 
mechanisms
 
of
 
Power
 
BI.
 
2.1.
 
The
 
Obsolescence
 
of
 
the
 
.pbix
 
Binary
 
Historically,
 
the
 
.pbix
 
file
 
was
 
a
 
"black
 
box."
 
It
 
was
 
a
 
zipped
 
archive
 
containing
 
binary
 
blobs
 
and
 
obfuscated
 
JSON
 
that
 
was
 
not
 
designed
 
for
 
external
 
modification.
 
This
 
made
 
automated
 
standardization
 
impossible;
 
a
 
developer
 
could
 
not
 
write
 
a
 
script
 
to
 
"change
 
all
 
background
 
colors"
 
or
 
"audit
 
all
 
measures"
 
without
 
opening
 
the
 
file
 
in
 
Power
 
BI
 
Desktop
 
or
 
using
 
unsupported
 
third-party
 
hacks.
1
 
2.2.
 
The
 
Rise
 
of
 
PBIP,
 
TMDL,
 
and
 
PBIR
 
The
 
introduction
 
of
 
the
 
Power
 
BI
 
Project
 
(.pbip)
 
format
 
deconstructs
 
the
 
report
 
into
 
a
 
folder
 
structure.
2
 
●
 
Semantic
 
Model
 
(.SemanticModel):
 
The
 
data
 
model
 
is
 
defined
 
using
 
TMDL
 
(.tmdl
 
files).
 
Unlike
 
the
 
previous
 
TMSL
 
(JSON)
 
format,
 
TMDL
 
is
 
designed
 
for
 
readability
 
and
 
manual
 
editing,
 
using
 
a
 
YAML-like
 
indentation
 
syntax.
6
 
This
 
allows
 
scripts
 
to
 
easily
 
parse
 
table
 
definitions,
 
measure
 
formulas,
 
and
 
relationship
 
properties
 
using
 
standard
 
text
 
processing
 
or
 
regular
 
expressions.
 
●
 
Report
 
Layout
 
(.Report):
 
The
 
visualization
 
layer
 
is
 
defined
 
using
 
PBIR
 
(.pbir
 
and
 
JSON
 
files).
 
With
 
the
 
2026
 
updates,
 
PBIR
 
splits
 
the
 
monolithic
 
report.json
 
into
 
individual
 
files
 
for
 
each
 
visual
 
and
 
page.
3
 
This
 
granularity
 
is
 
critical
 
for
 
our
 
POC;
 
it
 
allows
 
the
 
car_wash.py
 
script
 
to
 
target
 
specific
 
visuals
 
(e.g.,
 
"remove
 
background
 
from
 
all
 
Cards")
 
without
 
risking
 
corruption
 
of
 
the
 
entire
 
report
 
definition.
 
2.3.
 
The
 
Agentic
 
Advantage
 
in
 
Antigravity
 
Google's
 
Antigravity
 
IDE
 
represents
 
a
 
shift
 
from
 
"Copilot"
 
(autocomplete)
 
to
 
"Agent"
 
(autonomous
 
execution).
 
In
 
this
 
POC,
 
the
 
Antigravity
 
agent
 
acts
 
as
 
the
 
primary
 
operator.
4
 
It
 
does
 
not
 
just
 
suggest
 
code;
 
it
 
has
 
permissions
 
to:
 
1.
 
Read/Write
 
Files:
 
Traverse
 
the
 
BI_Factory
 
directory,
 
opening
 
.tmdl
 
and
 
.json
 
files.
 
2.
 
Execute
 
Terminal
 
Commands:
 
Run
 
Python
 
scripts
 
to
 
process
 
data.
 
3.
 
Manage
 
State:
 
Track
 
the
 
progress
 
of
 
batch
 
operations
 
and
 
log
 
results
 
to
 
audit_log.csv.
 
This
 
capability
 
allows
 
us
 
to
 
instruct
 
the
 
agent
 
to
 
"Standardize
 
all
 
legacy
 
reports,"
 
triggering
 
a
 
complex
 
chain
 
of
 
file
 
manipulations
 
that
 
would
 
take
 
a
 
human
 
hours
 
to
 
perform
 
manually.
 

3.
 
Architecture
 
of
 
the
 
BI_Factory
 
The
 
foundation
 
of
 
this
 
POC
 
is
 
a
 
strict
 
directory
 
taxonomy.
 
The
 
BI_Factory
 
is
 
not
 
merely
 
a
 
storage
 
location;
 
it
 
is
 
an
 
active
 
workspace
 
where
 
the
 
"Raw
 
Material"
 
(Legacy
 
Reports)
 
is
 
processed
 
into
 
"Finished
 
Goods"
 
(Standardized
 
Reports)
 
using
 
"Machinery"
 
(Scripts
 
and
 
Templates).
 
3.1.
 
Folder
 
Structure
 
Taxonomy
 
The
 
Antigravity
 
agent
 
must
 
be
 
instructed
 
to
 
initialize
 
the
 
following
 
structure.
 
This
 
separation
 
of
 
concerns
 
ensures
 
that
 
the
 
automation
 
is
 
non-destructive
 
(preserving
 
legacy
 
inputs)
 
and
 
auditable.

Technical
 
Dependencies
 
To
 
execute
 
the
 
scripts
 
within
 
Antigravity,
 
the
 
Python
 
environment
 
requires
 
specific
 
libraries
 
capable
 
of
 
handling
 
file
 
system
 
traversal
 
and
 
JSON
 
parsing.
 
While
 
TMDL
 
is
 
text-based,
 
robust
 
parsing
 
requires
 
careful
 
regex
 
handling.

Rationale
 
for
 
Specific
 
Checks
 
●
 
Auto
 
Date/Time
 
(R01):
 
This
 
feature
 
creates
 
hidden
 
tables
 
for
 
every
 
date
 
column,
 
bloating
 
model
 
size
 
and
 
confusing
 
users.
15
 
Disabling
 
it
 
is
 
the
 
single
 
most
 
effective
 
"quick
 
fix"
 
for
 
performance.
 
●
 
Bi-Directional
 
Filters
 
(R02):
 
These
 
introduce
 
ambiguity
 
and
 
performance
 
penalties.
 
They
 
should
 
only
 
be
 
used
 
in
 
specific
 
patterns
 
(e.g.,
 
Many-to-Many
 
bridge
 
tables)
 
and
 
are
 
generally
 
considered
 
a
 
"code
 
smell"
 
in
 
standard
 
reporting.
17
 
●
 
Documentation
 
(R05):
 
With
 
the
 
rise
 
of
 
Copilot
 
in
 
Power
 
BI,
 
measure
 
descriptions
 
are
 
no
 
longer
 
optional;
 
they
 
are
 
the
 
"prompt"
 
that
 
allows
 
AI
 
to
 
understand
 
the
 
model.
18
 
Enforcing
 
this
 
ensures
 
the
 
model
 
is
 
AI-ready.
 
5.
 
The
 
Engine
 
Room:
 
Automation
 
Scripts
 
The
 
core
 
of
 
this
 
POC
 
lies
 
in
 
the
 
Python
 
scripts
 
residing
 
in
 
04_Scripts.
 
These
 
scripts
 
utilize
 
the
 
Antigravity
 
agent's
 
ability
 
to
 
execute
 
code
 
against
 
the
 
local
 
file
 
system.
 
5.1.
 
validator.py
 
(The
 
Auditor)
 
This
 
script
 
performs
 
a
 
read-only
 
pass
 
of
 
a
 
target
 
.pbip
 
folder.
 
It
 
does
 
not
 
modify
 
files;
 
it
 
generates
 
the
 
score.
 
Technical
 
Implementation:
 
The
 
script
 
utilizes
 
pathlib
 
to
 
iterate
 
recursively
 
through
 
the
 
target
 
directory.
 
1.
 
TMDL
 
Parsing:
 
It
 
locates
 
*.SemanticModel/definition/*.tmdl.
 
It
 
reads
 
these
 
files
 
as
 
text.
 
using
 
re
 
(regex),
 
it
 
counts
 
occurrences
 
of
 
measure
 
and
 
checks
 
if
 
the
 
subsequent
 
lines
 
contain
 
description:.
 
It
 
scans
 
for
 
autoDateTime:
 
true
 
in
 
the
 
model.tmdl
 
file.
 
2.
 
PBIR
 
Parsing:
 
It
 
locates
 
*.Report/definition/pages/*/visuals/*.json.
 
It
 
performs
 
a
 
len()
 
count
 
on
 
the
 
list
 
of
 
files
 
to

car_wash.py
 
(The
 
Fixer)
 
This
 
script
 
performs
 
deterministic
 
remediation.
 
It
 
addresses
 
the
 
issues
 
found
 
by
 
the
 
validator
 
that
 
can
 
be
 
safely
 
automated.
 
Theme
 
Injection
 
Strategy:
 
The
 
script
 
utilizes
 
the
 
Theme.json
 
and
 
Background.svg
 
assets.
 
1.
 
Base64
 
Encoding:
 
It
 
reads
 
Background.svg
 
in
 
binary
 
mode,
 
encodes
 
it
 
to
 
Base64,
 
and
 
constructs
 
the
 
data
 
URI
 
(data:image/svg+xml;base64,...).
 
2.
 
JSON
 
Construction:
 
It
 
loads
 
Theme.json,
 
injects
 
this
 
URI
 
into
 
visualStyles
 
->
 
page
 
->
 
*
 
->
 

background
 
->
 
image
 
->
 
url,
 
and
 
ensures
 
transparency
 
is
 
set
 
to
 
0.
12
 
3.
 
File
 
Overwrite:
 
It
 
copies
 
this
 
compiled
 
theme
 
into
 
the
 
report's
 
StaticResources
 
folder
 
and
 
updates
 
the
 
mobileState.json
 
or
 
report.json
 
to
 
verify
 
the
 
theme
 
reference
 
is
 
active.
 
TMDL
 
Surgery:
 
To
 
fix
 
Auto
 
Date/Time,
 
the
 
script
 
locates
 
model.tmdl.
 
It
 
uses
 
regex
 
substitution
 
to
 
replace
 
autoDateTime:
 
true
 
with
 
autoDateTime:
 
false.
 
●
 
Risk
 
Mitigation:
 
Manipulating
 
TMDL
 
via
 
regex
 
can
 
be
 
risky
 
if
 
the
 
syntax
 
changes.
 
However,
 
for
 
simple
 
properties
 
like
 
autoDateTime
 
or
 
crossFilteringBehavior,
 
the
 
syntax
 
is
 
stable
 
enough
 
for
 
this
 
POC.
6
 
Visual
 
Scrubbing:
 
The
 
script
 
iterates
 
through
 
all
 
PBIR
 
visual
 
JSON
 
files.
 
It
 
searches
 
for
 
specific
 
formatting
 
keys
 
that
 
override
 
the
 
theme
 
(e.g.,
 
solidColor
 
in
 
the
 
formatting
 
object).
 
If
 
found,
 
it
 
deletes
 
those
 
specific
 
key-value
 
pairs,
 
effectively
 
"resetting"
 
the
 
visual
 
to
 
the
 
defaults
 
defined
 
in
 
the
 
injected
 
Theme.json.

5.3.
 
doc_generator.py
 
(The
 
Scribe)
 
This
 
script
 
generates
 
a
 
README.md
 
file
 
in
 
the
 
root
 
of
 
the
 
project
 
folder.
 
This
 
ensures
 
every
 
report
 
has
 
"Live
 
Documentation."
 
Content
 
Generation:
 
1.
 
Header:
 
Report
 
Name,
 
Last
 
Updated
 
Timestamp,
 
Compliance
 
Score
 
(read
 
from
 
the
 
latest
 
audit
 
log
 
entry).
 
2.
 
Model
 
Schema:
 
It
 
lists
 
all
 
tables
 
and
 
a
 
count
 
of
 
measures,
 
extracted
 
from
 
the
 
TMDL.
 
3.
 
Change
 
Log:
 
If
 
the
 
folder
 
is
 
a
 
Git
 
repository,
 
it
 
uses
 
git
 
log
 
to
 
pull
 
the
 
last
 
5
 
commits.
 
If
 
not,
 
it
 
lists
 
the
 
actions
 
taken
 
by
 
car_wash.py
 
(e.g.,
 
"Auto-fixed
 
Date
 
Table
 
settings").
 
4.
 
Markdown
 
Formatting:
 
The
 
script
 
uses
 
formatted
 
strings
 
(f-strings)
 
to
 
construct
 
a
 
clean
 
Markdown
 
document
 
table
 
representing
 
the

to
 
the

generated
 
by
 
the

8.1.
 
Data
 
Connectivity
 
Since
 
the
 
audit_log.csv
 
is
 
a
 
local
 
file
 
in
 
BI_Factory/03_Logs/,
 
the
 
dashboard
 
uses
 
the
 
Folder
 
connector
 
or
 
Text/CSV
 
connector.
 
●
 
Transformation:
 
Power
 
Query
 
is
 
used
 
to

the
 
"Violations"
 
column
 
(which
 
stores
 
a
 
JSON-like
 
list
 
of

Conclusion
 
This
 
Proof
 
of
 
Concept
 
successfully
 
demonstrates
 
that
 
the
 
"10/10
 
Power
 
BI
 
Standardization
 
Framework"
 
is
 
not
 
only
 
viable
 
but
 
highly
 
effective
 
when
 
executed
 
within
 
the
 
Antigravity
 
IDE.
 
By
 
leveraging
 
the
 
granular
 
file
 
structures
 
of
 
PBIP,
 
TMDL,
 
and
 
PBIR,
 
we
 
have
 
effectively
 
"industrialized"
 
the
 
reporting
 
lifecycle.
 
The
 
shift
 
is
 
profound:
 
●
 
From
 
Subjective
 
to
 
Objective:
 
Quality
 
is
 
no
 
longer
 
an
 
opinion;
 
it
 
is
 
a
 
calculated
 
score
 

derived
 
from
 
code.
 
●
 
From
 
Manual
 
to
 
Agentic:
 
The
 
developer
 
shifts
 
from
 
"fixing
 
formatting"
 
to
 
"orchestrating
 
agents"
 
that
 
fix
 
formatting.
 
●
 
From
 
Opaque
 
to
 
Transparent:
 
Every
 
report
 
is
 
now
 
self-documenting
 
and
 
fully
 
auditable.
 
As
 
Power
 
BI
 
continues
 
to
 
evolve
 
towards
 
2026,
 
embracing
 
this
 
file-based,
 
automation-first
 
approach
 
is
 
the
 
only
 
sustainable
 
way
 
to
 
manage
 
enterprise
 
BI
 
environments.
 
This
 
POC
 
provides
 
the
 
blueprint
 
for
 
that
 
future.
