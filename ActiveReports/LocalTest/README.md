# 🧪 LocalTest - Development & Testing Reports

This folder contains reports that are in **active development** and **local testing**.

## 📌 Purpose

- Experimental features and new development
- Testing governance rules before production
- Prototypes and proof-of-concepts
- Learning and training reports

## ✅ Guidelines

**When to use:**
- You're developing a new report
- Testing new features or DAX formulas
- Experimenting with different designs
- Creating proof-of-concepts

**Governance:**
- Relaxed governance enforcement
- Failed checks are guidance, not blockers
- Use this to test before moving to Production

**Best Practices:**
- Keep test data small
- Document what you're testing
- Clean up old tests periodically
- Move completed reports to Production/
